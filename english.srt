1
00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:18,500
She should be at the temple at this hour.

2
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:22,870
The line to see the Lady Cleric is here.

3
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:25,010
Please have your ticket in hand.

4
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:30,510
Man, I feel alive again!

5
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:32,760
My body feels so much lighter.

6
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:39,790
Looks like she's working hard again
today. Hopefully not too hard.

7
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:44,920
I believe there is.

8
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,350
If we find a cleric who can exorcise evil...

9
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:52,110
But she rarely takes on jobs
to remove curse-based skills.

10
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:55,700
There may be some reason behind it,

11
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:58,880
but I'm her best friend,
and she won't even tell me.

12
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:08,270
Lady Cleric...

13
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:09,880
I'm taking a break.

14
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:12,550
I apologize, but please wait.

15
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:13,710
Understood.

16
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:26,020
Oh, whoops...

17
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:29,800
I seem to be out of energy.

18
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:33,400
It appears as though you're
working too hard, Lady Cleric.

19
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:35,470
Oh, it's you, Lola.

20
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:38,860
That's quite the greeting for someone
who's worried about you.

21
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:42,300
I apologize.

22
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:50,020
So what's the very capable receptionist
from the guild doing here today?

23
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:53,090
I hate to ask this when I know you're tired,

24
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:55,990
but I needed to discuss
something important with you.

25
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:33,670
Today's the day that Lola is going
to introduce us to this cleric.

26
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:36,950
I had some time before we
were supposed to meet up,

27
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:39,510
so I decided to get some
advice from my master.

28
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:42,910
"Hidden dungeon only I can enter!

29
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:45,310
Let me train in secret to become
the strongest in the world!"

30
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,700
Hmph.

31
00:03:56,670 --> 00:04:01,720
#04 "The Untainted Cleric"

32
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:59,050
Hmphity hmph.

33
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:00,750
M-Master?

34
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:02,510
Are you mad about something?

35
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:06,990
Well, you haven't come see me at all!

36
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:10,140
I feel like it's been about two weeks.

37
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:12,110
S-Sorry about that!

38
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:14,730
I meant to come sooner,

39
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,440
but I ran into a little problem.

40
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:24,550
I see. A duke's daughter with a curse.

41
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:25,630
Yes.

42
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:29,670
If it's a curse-based skill,
it might have to do with her family.

43
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:33,210
Her family? You mean something
to do with her ancestors?

44
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:35,460
Yeah, it happens all the time!

45
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:38,360
There's a skill to curse one's descendants.

46
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,090
But that's...

47
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:46,290
You'll need over 10,000 LP to Get Creative
enough to create the skill to undo it.

48
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:50,690
It's probably best if you let
that cleric girl handle it.

49
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:53,230
Right. That's what I plan on doing, but...

50
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:56,070
I wonder what the Lady Cleric is like.

51
00:04:56,070 --> 00:05:00,500
If she has the skill to exorcise things,
she's probably at least part elf.

52
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,180
An elf, huh?

53
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:03,860
You don't see them very often.

54
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,690
It's great to fulfill some of
your desires with other species.

55
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:10,030
You'll get lots of extra LP with them!

56
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:11,240
What?!

57
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:15,490
You gotta go for the glory!

58
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:17,000
Wh-What are you—

59
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:23,260
S-So, Master, what would you
do to earn about 10,000 LP?

60
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:27,040
Oh, in my case... Here.
I'll whisper it to you.

61
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:33,220
First...

62
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:37,100
...to get their body extra sensitive...

63
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:39,710
...tie down their...

64
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:42,860
...and while they're...

65
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:46,950
Then you'll have 10,000 LP in no time!

66
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:52,880
Jeez, I'm kidding. You're so cute, Noir.

67
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:56,250
Sh-She's totally messing with me...

68
00:05:56,770 --> 00:05:59,250
You probably won't be able to
get 10,000 that quickly,

69
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:03,070
but I can teach you a skill
that'll be super useful in gaining LP.

70
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:05,960
Really? That'll be great!

71
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:11,480
Okay! Let your awesome master
Olivia fill you in on the deets.

72
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,610
Thank you!

73
00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:18,730
And now, for those deets...

74
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:21,480
You'll get the best bang for your buck!
This forbidden skill is...

75
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:32,370
Lucky Lecher

76
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:29,570
It only takes a measly 300 LP to get,
but it's effective as hell!

77
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:32,370
Only takes 300 LP to get!

78
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:32,370
You'll have some indescribable experiences!

79
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:35,950
Get Creative to make Lucky Lecher!

Noir! Took you long enough!

84
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:52,720
The Lady Cleric and Lola
are gonna show up soon!

85
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,710
Huh?

86
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:58,410
Whoops, sorry!

87
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:14,280
Th-That Time I Faceplanted into Slime Boobs.

88
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:26,060
Eek!

89
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,450
No!

90
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:32,470
Damn, my luck just won't stop!

91
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:37,040
This is how effective Lucky Lecher is?

92
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,640
Buh-ling!

93
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,640
Th-This skill's amazing!

94
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,850
You're the best, Master.

95
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:45,840
Buh-ling!

96
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,270
But this is going to affect my life.

97
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,860
I just need to use Editor
to tinker with it a bit.

98
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:53,690
Lucky Lecher.

99
00:07:51,860 --> 00:08:08,670
Lucky Lecher

100
00:07:53,360 --> 00:08:08,670
Causes erotic situations to occur

101
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:56,860
Causes erotic situations to occur with
nearby members of the opposite sex.

102
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:59,660
with nearby members of the opposite sex.

103
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:58,650
Just need to add "rarely."

104
00:07:58,700 --> 00:07:59,330
Spent

105
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:08,670
with nearby members of the opposite sex.

106
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:08,670
"rarely"

107
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:03,310
As well as, "Skill will not trigger
during serious situations."

108
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:03,710
Spent

109
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:08,630
"Skill will not trigger during serious situations."

110
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:08,580
Gotta make sure these only
happen at the right time.

111
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:14,160
Hey! What are you smirking about?!

112
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,180
I-I'm not!

113
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:19,250
You were totally staring
at those other girls, too!

114
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,880
That must be Noir.

115
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:21,060
Noir, you doofus!

116
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:24,240
He's pretty cute.

117
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,650
Just my type, actually.

118
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:28,520
Uh, Luna? What's that supposed to mean?!

119
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,410
Oh, Lola.

120
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:31,610
And...

121
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:34,470
The Lady Cleric?

122
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:40,450
Sorry to keep you two waiting. This is...

123
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:44,210
Luna Heela. It's nice to meet you two.

124
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:45,990
L-Likewise.

125
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:48,260
N-Nice to meet you.

126
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:49,380
Yeah.

127
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:52,090
We've got reservations.
We can talk there.

128
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:57,340
Her silky, smooth, silvery locks...

129
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:59,540
Look at her from behind...

130
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:01,520
Her tight but perky butt...

131
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,950
Then her long, slim legs...

132
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,090
My only advantage over her is my boobs!

133
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:10,780
I never should've let Noir meet her.

134
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:12,820
Uh, Emma? Come on, let's go.

135
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:22,790
Lola told me the basics.

136
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:25,710
So this person you want me to look at...

137
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:27,980
Miss Maria. She's the daughter of a duke.

138
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:33,820
So it's her.

139
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,600
I've actually looked at her before...

140
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,680
But I declined lifting her curse.

141
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:44,310
But why? Don't you have
a skill to lift curses?

142
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:48,740
Yes, I do. With no problems.

143
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:49,810
But...

144
00:09:57,530 --> 00:10:00,630
I can't lift the Sixteenth Year Death Curse.

145
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:02,830
I can't save her.

146
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:10,250
How's Maria currently doing?

147
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:12,880
She doesn't even have a week to live.

148
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:16,830
She suffers convulsions
that pain her entire body.

149
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:20,470
Apparently, the intervals are getting shorter.

150
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:23,940
So her curse has progressed that far...

151
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:28,430
Luna, you don't need to
feel responsible for this.

152
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:31,640
You save dozens of people every day.

153
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:34,540
That itself is an amazing feat.

154
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:39,510
It seems that Luna feels
pretty responsible for this.

155
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:42,420
Maybe she does have some kind of secret.

156
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,160
Discerning Eye.

00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:49,620
Yeah, she definitely has the Lift Curse skill...

159
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:56,380

00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:52,270
Erases curse skills.

162
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:56,380
However, the user's... lifespan is reduced?!

163
00:10:57,470 --> 00:11:01,560
So when she lifts the curse,
Luna's own lifespan is...

164
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:17,080
Here it comes! This is a huge load!

165
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:22,490
Elves live far longer than humans.

166
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:25,410
But apparently, even so,
Miss Maria's curse is so powerful

167
00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:27,790
that her lifespan can't cover it.

168
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,260
Noir...

169
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:36,330
Lead me to Miss Maria's home.

170
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:39,340
I will lift her curse.

171
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:42,950
B-But you just said you
couldn't lift her curse.

172
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:45,200
Well...

173
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,840
Emma, Lola.

174
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,850
Could you leave us for a bit?

175
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,290
I'd like to talk to Luna in private.

176
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:00,320
Sorry this is so sudden.

177
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:04,260
I took a look at your stats with my skill.

178
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:09,210
If you cure Miss Maria,
that means your life...

179
00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:11,120
Stop! Don't say anymore!

180
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:11,910
But—

181
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:15,340
She's at death's door, isn't she?

182
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:21,170
How could I possibly leave her alone
knowing her life is at stake?

183
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:28,680
I want to save people.

184
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:31,890
Just like my mother would have done.

185
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:38,260
My mother was also a cleric.

186
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:42,160
Even though she knew that
her lifespan was at stake,

187
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,400
she continued lifting curses.

188
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:49,940
She kept her chipping away at her own
lifespan to save those who were suffering.

189
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:53,460
And now, she's no longer with us.

190
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:54,700
But...

191
00:12:56,430 --> 00:12:59,800
I'm very proud of my mother.

192
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:05,960
Luna...

193
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:08,830
And because I am my mother's daughter,

194
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:11,570
I want to use this power for others...

195
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:22,200
The Hidden Dungeon Only I Can Enter.

196
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:30,050
There's trouble!

197
00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:32,870
A wall collapsed! Someone help!

198
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:34,480
There's a child underneath!

199
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,000
He's terribly injured!

200
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:39,090
Hey, are you okay?

201
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:44,930
Hang in there!

202
00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:47,120
W-We need to heal him immediately.

203
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:50,620
I wonder sometimes...

204
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:54,400
Why are we born into this world?

205
00:13:55,330 --> 00:13:59,120
I still don't know the answer to that.

206
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,460
It's all right.

207
00:14:01,410 --> 00:14:04,070
I'm sure you'll find that answer someday.

208
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:07,570
I guess you've already found yours, Luna.

209
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:09,180
Yes.

210
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:13,120
I can save lives and bring
about so many smiles.

211
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:15,500
That is my mission!

212
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:23,300

213
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:33,510
Thank goodness!

214
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:34,310
Luna!

215
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:35,990
W-Wow...

216
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:38,810
I guess your cleric title isn't just for show.

217
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:43,290
Luna—

218
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:49,610
Huh?! Luna?!

219
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:53,030
Are you... Huh?!

220
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:58,960
I don't
wanna die

221
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:58,960
I-I don't wanna die...

222
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:03,180
Curses are scary!

223
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:05,460
Where did all of her bravery go?!

224
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:07,480
Wait, could this be...

225

Depleting mana or receiving

229
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:15,970
intense attacks may make the

230
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:15,970
user even more cowardly.

231
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:15,970
Th-This probably sucks a lot.

232
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:22,170
Luna!

233
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:24,130
Oh, I knew it.

234
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:27,510
Luna's always like this.

235
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:30,340
Don't worry, she'll be awake in no time.

236
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,350
Mommy...

237
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:40,000
Don't worry, Mommy's right here.
Come on, now, up you go.

238
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:45,840
I can't believe you saw that!
Please just forget it!

239
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:49,960
Please! Please! I beg of you!

240
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,350
Hey, it's okay...

241
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:52,300
Yeah.

242
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:56,870
Now, let us proceed! Maria needs our help!

243
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:57,680
Onward!

244
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:02,050
B-But...

245
00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:05,660
Y-You don't need to worry about me...

246
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:07,360
I'm not scared of... anything...

247
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:10,750
Luna, let's figure out another way.

248
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:11,530
Huh?

249
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:14,090
B-But why?

250
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:15,140
Your legs.

251
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:19,310
I-I just can't contain my excitement!

252
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:21,880
But you said you were scared of curses.

253
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:24,250
What? No way. Can't recall.

254
00:16:25,570 --> 00:16:27,080
Bad Luna!

255
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:30,180
Just tell us the truth already.

256
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:33,630
You're scared, aren't you?

257
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:39,510
If I save Maria, it's very likely
that I'm going to...

258
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,160
die.

259
00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:47,870
Just thinking about that is terrifying.

260
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:51,570
I'm a failure as a cleric.

261
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:58,690
You'll die if you lift a curse?

262
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,830
You never told me that before!

263
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:04,480
I'm sorry I didn't tell you. But I...

264
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:06,610
Huh...

265
00:17:06,610 --> 00:17:09,490
So I've been hanging out
with you this whole time

266
00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:12,210
without realizing something that important.

267
00:17:12,210 --> 00:17:13,880
N-No!

268
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:16,900
Some best friend! It pisses me off!

269
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:22,580
I'm so mad that I was so clueless.

270
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:23,600
Huh?

271
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:28,000
I'm sorry I didn't realize how
much you were suffering.

272
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:31,910
You're always like this, Luna!

273
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:35,810
You always put others before yourself!

275
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,880
Rely on me... Please.

276
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,320

277
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:44,870
Okay.

278
00:17:49,690 --> 00:17:52,000
Lola... Luna...

279
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:56,940
There's something great about these two.

280
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:05,460
Sorry about all this.

281
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:08,900
You ended up witnessing
such an embarrassing scene.

282
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:12,520
Oh, no. It was a feast for my eyes.

283
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:15,780
Er, I was very moved by you two.

284
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:17,690
But what should we do?

285
00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:21,090
If we try to save Miss Maria,
then Luna will...

286

Don't worry.

Things aren't completely hopeless yet.

288

without any casualties.

Earlier, I just gave it a shot,

00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:54,210
A-Anyway! Can you think of a way
for me to get 2,000 more LP?

329
00:19:54,210 --> 00:19:57,530
And maybe something
that'll increase Luna's finances.

330
00:19:58,550 --> 00:20:00,480
You make it sound so easy.

331
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,800
I highly doubt there's
anything that convenient.

332
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:03,860
But there is.

333
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:04,740
Huh?!

334
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:10,720
A certain noble holds the perfect event
for this occasion every week.

335
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:13,440
The next time it will be held is this weekend,

336
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:16,400
so we'll make it just in time to lift the curse.

337
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:19,100
What kind of event is it?

338
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:21,060
It's called...

339
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:22,110
It's called...?

340
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:24,460
The Harem Pride Event!

341
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:30,140
Sorry to keep you waiting, my dudes!

342
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:35,840
Tonight, another ten that
I'm jealous of... I mean...

343
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:42,620
We'll be meeting some reckless scoundrels
who'll be showing off their hot girlfriends

344
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:44,720
for a chance at one million rels!

345
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,240
Unforgivable!

346
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,390
Boo!

347
00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:49,470
Those lucky bastards!

348
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:50,720
Piss off!

349
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:58,250
So vent all the stress you can at
the sight of these shitty normies!

350
00:21:00,330 --> 00:21:05,150
Apparently, the host of this event has been
betrayed by women countless times.

351
00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:10,770
And the gentlemen who have gathered
here have experienced something similar.

352
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:13,900
Most of them, apparently,
don't have any lovers.

353
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,720
Death to hot guys!

354
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,770
Screw harems!

355
00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:20,630
Harems are unforgivable!

356
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:26,630
Th-This isn't a pride event...
This is slander.

357
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:29,470
Are you ready, my dudes?

358
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:34,310
Let the Harem Pride Event commence!

359
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:47,360
I-I think I want to go home now...

360
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Alice Theater

361
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:24,840
Alice Theater.

362
00:23:27,690 --> 00:23:30,160
Big Brother...

363
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:34,100
Y-You're back!

364
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:36,100
What were you doing, Alice?

365
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:38,640
Th-This is just... um...

366
00:23:38,910 --> 00:23:41,390
I was just fixing your sheets!

367
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:42,980
They seem messier than before.

368
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:47,550
Don't worry. I'm just going
to sleep in them as-is.

369
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:50,350
Huh? Big Brother?

370
00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:53,520
I mean... we're siblings.

371
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:56,780
We used to sleep together
like this all the time.

372
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:59,500
Y-Yes, of course!

373
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:06,970
U-Uh, hello? Alice is your little sister.

374
00:24:06,970 --> 00:24:10,420
There's no way... my LP would go up...

375
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:13,920
Why?

376
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:20,420
Next time, "The Future of This Harem."

377
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:21,980
#05 "The Future of This Harem"
